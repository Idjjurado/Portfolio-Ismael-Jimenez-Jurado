## Description
Within this portfolio you will find the progression of my projects from HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript! 

Alongside all of those additional projects you will find things that I have found that I've wanted to learn more about when integrating different styligns or features that are newer forms of code being used within the industry!

Feel free to ask questions, follow, or contact for any needs! Thank you!

## Usage

This is a porfolio that wil be used to put my skillsets, experience, and personality on display for those curious! It will include previous and current projects that are either actively being refactored or refined in some way!
