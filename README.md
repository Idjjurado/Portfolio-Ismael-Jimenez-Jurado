# Portfolio-Ismael-Jimenez-Jurado
This is a portfolio for all of my projects and myself as an Engineer!
You will learn some about me and the best ways to get in contact as well.

## WELCOME!!

## Description
Within this portfolio you will find the progression of my projects from HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript! 

Alongside all of those additional projects you will find things that I have found that I've wanted to learn more about when integrating different styligns or features that are newer forms of code being used within the industry!

Feel free to ask questions, follow, or contact for any needs! Thank you!
